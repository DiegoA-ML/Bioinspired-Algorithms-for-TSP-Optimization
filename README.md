# Bioinspired-Algorithms-for-TSP-Optimization
In this project, we employed bioinspired algorithms to solve the classic Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and compared their performance to an exact optimization model. The TSP is an NP-hard problem where the objective is to find the shortest possible route visiting all nodes exactly once. We focused on networks ranging from 40 to 200 nodes.
